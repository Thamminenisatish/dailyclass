Process Management:

Process:
	Instance of Program execution
	Process having:   PID
			->Child Process
			->Parent Process
command: "ps -a"  
    "0"  --   child process
    "+ve"  -- parent process
    "-ve"  --process failed

Process Creation:
            2 methods
     1.fork()
     2.vfork()
     3.exec()

fork():
        we create a file,   fork() will creates duplicate process.
new process is called as child process.
"2^n"  times print 
vfork():
        first child process will execute
        same memory will allocate to both parent and child
exec():
       won't create duplicate process

Process States:

Process:
  
      1.Zambie Process   ---  complete the execution by "exit/kill" but still
there is any entry in the process table.
      2.Orphan Process  --    process having no parent to child(first parent was killed or executed)
      3.Init Process    --    super parent to all processes    
      4.Daemon Process  --    process which is run on background


"top"  ---  like history command
"cat"   -- for display

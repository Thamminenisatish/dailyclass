1.Host A having IP address of Host D
  Host A L3 header creates
  Host A needs to learn MAC address of default gateway

2.Host A sends ARP request for 11.11.11.1
3.Switch1 recives the request or frame
  Switch1 learns mac address of Host A(aaaa)
  Switch1 floods frames to all ports
4.Host B discards the frame
5.Router receives the ARP request
  will learns Host A MAC address
6.Router gives ARP reply
7.Switch1 recives that frmae and learns MAC address of router
8.Host A recives the ARP reply and learns router's ARP mapping

9.Host A creates L2 header and sends packet
10. Switch1 recives the request and already having MAC address
11.Switch1 sends to Router and router recives 

12.Router will consult 22.22.22.0/24 will for destination
   will check for 22.22.22.40 and learns MAC address
13. Router will sends ARP request to 22.22.22.40
14. Switch2 recives the frame and learns MAC address for 22.22.22.40
    Switch2 floods the frame to all ports
15. Host C will discards the request
16. Host D will receives the request and learns router ARP mapping
17. Host D will give ARP reply
18. Switch2 will receives ARP reply and forward to Router
19. Router creates L2 header and sends packet
20. Switch2 recives the frame
21. Switch2 will forward to Host D
22. Host D stripes L2 header and L3 header and finally receives Data
23.Host D gives respond to Host A.
